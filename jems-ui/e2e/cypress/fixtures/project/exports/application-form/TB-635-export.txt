C.8 Long-term plans
As a programme, we would like to support projects that have a long-lasting effect in the territory and those 
who will benefit from them. Please describe below what you will do to ensure this.
C.8.1 Ownership
Please describe who will ensure the financial and institutional support for the outputs/deliverables 
developed by the project (e.g., tools), and explain how these outputs/deliverables will be integrated in the 
work of the institutions.
C.8.2 Durability
Some outputs/deliverables should be used by relevant groups (project partners or others) after the 
project's lifetime, in order to have a lasting effect on the territory and the population. For example, new 
practices in urban transport need to be used by local authorities to have cleaner air in the city, and the 
whole population will benefit from this. Please describe how your outputs/deliverables will be used after 
the project ends and by whom.
C.8.3 Transferability
Some outputs/deliverables that you will deliver could be adapted or further developed to be used by other 
target groups or in other territories. What will you do to make sure that relevant groups are aware of your 
outputs/deliverables and are able to use them?
